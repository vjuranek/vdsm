lvmfilter - Generate LVM filter

This module provides the infrastructure for configuring LVM filter on a
host, ensuring that LVM can access only the devices needed by the host
mounted filesystems, and cannot access logical volumes on shared
storage, which are owned by Vdsm.

The module should be used from command line running as root such as
vdsm-tool.

This module really belongs in LVM or anaconda. Limiting the vdsm
dependencies to make it easy to take out of vdsm in the future.

For more info why LVM filter is needed, see
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1449968
